          I studied CS and Math at McGill University and worked for Microsoft
          for two years. I quit my job in April 2023, and now I'm working
          full-time on developing a cool iOS app with my friends.
          <br />
          I've been programming for {new Date().getFullYear() - 2018} years,
          long enough to know my way around the keyboard, too short a time to be
          blas√© about charms lying in lines of codes.
          <br />
          Welcome to the home to my floating thoughts.
